# üåü My Project Portfolio: Joseph M. Marra üöÄ

Welcome to my project portfolio repository! My name is Joe, and I am an aspiring AI/Robotics engineer studying Computer Science at the **Georgia Institute of Technology** üêù. This collection showcases various applications and systems I've developed, demonstrating a diverse range of skills in AI integration, robotics, and web development. Each project aims to solve real-world problems or enhance efficiency through innovative solutions.

## üíª Featured Projects

### üå±üí∞ Invest4Better: Sustainable & Profitable Investing App

**Overview:** [Invest4Better](https://invest4better.org/) is an application developed for the Congressional App Challenge. It empowers users to make investment decisions that are not only financially sound but also environmentally responsible. It guides users through sector selection based on ESG scores, allows them to analyze selected companies with a proprietary **I4B Index**, and provides **AI-powered recommendations** for sustainable and profitable investments.

### ü§ñ FTC Autonomous & TeleOp OpModes

**Overview:** As a member of the Jaybots, the FTC robotics team at John Jay High School, I held the positions of **Equipment Manager**,**Corporate Outreach Manager**, and most recently, **Build Leader**. This past season, we advanced to the _FIRST_ World Championship through the 3rd Place Inspire Award. I have had a large role in both programming and building the robot. I will detail the software for an FTC robot, encompassing both its **Autonomous** and **Driver-Controlled (TeleOp)** operational modes. It focuses on precision robotics, utilizing advanced motion planning for pre-programmed tasks and intelligent sensor integration for responsive manual control during competitions.

### üî´ Electromagnetic Gauss Rifle Tracking & Aiming System

**Overview:** This project combines computer vision with precision servo control to create an intelligent aiming mechanism. It's designed to detect and track objects in real-time using a camera, then autonomously adjust the horizontal and vertical aim of an electromagnetic coil gun to keep the target centered.
