## üíª How It Works

Invest4Better is a dynamic web application that combines financial data with AI insights to help users identify promising sustainable investment opportunities.

1.  **Sector Selection:** Users start by **choosing a specific sector** to explore. This allows them to narrow down their focus.

2.  **Sector Sustainability Overview:** The app visualizes sectors based on their average **ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) scores**.

    - **ESG Score:** This rating evaluates a company's performance on sustainability and ethical practices, assessing factors like environmental impact, social responsibility, and governance structures. A higher ESG score typically indicates a company's commitment to responsible business practices.

    - **Interpretation in Invest4Better:** For the purpose of Invest4Better's calculations and scoring, **lower ESG scores are considered better**, indicating less negative impact or stronger positive practices.

    - **Visual Cues:**

      - **Circle Size:** Larger circles indicate a **bigger market capitalization** for companies within that sector.

      - **Color Coding for Sector ESG:** The color of the sector represents the average ESG score of all companies within it, relative to other sectors:

        - **Light Green:** Highly Above Average Sustainability Practices

        - **Dark Green:** Above Average Sustainability Practices

        - **Yellow:** Average Sustainability Practices

        - **Orange:** Questionable Sustainability Practices

        - **Red:** Problematic Sustainability Practices

3.  **Company Selection:** After selecting a sector, the app displays **all S&P 500 companies within that sector**. Users can then **select up to three companies** for detailed analysis.

4.  **I4B Index Calculation:** For the selected companies, the **I4B Index** is calculated and displayed. This proprietary index is determined by the **Net Profit Margin divided by the ESG Score**.

    - **I4B Index Purpose:** It helps users understand how much profit a company generates relative to its environmental impact, with a **higher I4B Index indicating a better balance** of profitability and sustainability.

5.  **Financial Data Fetching:** The application integrates with the **Financial Modeling Prep API** to retrieve up-to-date financial statements, key metrics, and stock data for the selected companies.

6.  **AI Recommendation & Analysis:** Using **OpenAI's API** (and potentially **Azure's AI services** for scalable deployments), the system processes and analyzes the crunch financial data and ESG data for the three selected companies. It then generates a **comprehensive AI-powered recommendation** on which stock to consider buying, weighing both financial performance and ESG factors equally.

7.  **Investment Analysis & Presentation:** The processed financial, environmental, and AI-generated insights are presented to the user in a clear, digestible format, allowing them to compare and evaluate potential investments based on both profit potential and environmental responsibility.
